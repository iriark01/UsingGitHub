#Using MD, GitHub and docs.mbed.org

Hello Oulu,

As promised, here is a small guide to using MD, GitHub and docs.mbed.org. Please remember that we're still experimenting ourselves, and there are no hard rules: whatever works best for your team is what you should do.

#The GitHub Client

The easiest way (for me) is to work with the GitHub client on my Mac, not through the website itself.

I understand that Rob set you up with GitHub users. So all you need now is the client: [Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [Windows](https://windows.github.com/). Install and enjoy. 

#Creating a Repo on GitHub

The easiest way:

1. Create a folder on your computer.

2. Drag-and-drop it to the GitHub client.

3.  You'll be asked if you want to create a repo. The answer is "yes".

4. The new repo is created under *Other*. 

5. Add a commit comment to it. Please remember that people can see this.

6. Click **Commit to master**.

7. Click **Publish**.
